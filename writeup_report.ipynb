    "#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed\n",
    "\n",
    "My model was inspired by the model developed by nVIDIA for the same task (https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Three sections can be identified:\n",
    " 1. Preprocessing (model.py lines 91-92): crops the image (70 pixels above and 24 below) changes the color space into YUV (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YUV#Conversion_to/from_RGB). I introduce a bias of -0.5 in the Y channel in order to have simmetrical inputs.\n",
    " 2. Convolutions (model.py lines 94-100): 5 convolutional layers separated by non-linear activation functions. I chose exponential linear units (ELUs) as main activation functions because alleviate the vanishing gradient problem (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07289). Only for the first layer I adopted a CReLU (model.py line 95), because it has been shown that the first convolutional layer usually learns *complementary* features (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05201). As a consequence, the number of channels of the first layer has been halved w.r.t. the original nVIDIA implementation.\n",
    " 3. Top (model.py lines 102-107): a dense MLP built on top of the last, flattened convolutional layer. I inserted a dropout layer (with 0.5 probability) just before the flattening in order to reduce the probability of overfitting the training data. Again, I put ELUs activation functions between layers, while I used a softsign activation function (model.py line 107) as final output in order to have values between -1 and 1. This helped to reduce the incidence of *saturating* the steering."

    "#### 1. Solution Design Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "At first I thought to only train a MLP on top of one of the networks already trained on ImageNet that Keras offers. Unfortunately, the size of the final network was usually too big also for AWS G2.x2large instances: I usually ended up with very small batches (2-4) and very long lasting epochs. The bottleneck was the first dense layer, as it had to connect to **every** \"pixel\" of the last convolutional layer, and sometimes even few hundreds were impractible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore I switched to nVIDIA model, that was much simpler but still has already shown to be able to perform the job. The only problem was that it was applied to YUV space, so I had to implement the conversion with Keras+Tensorflow. I kept the dense layer size I was already using as it seemed to me that the nVIDIA model cutted too early the number of neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to introduce some modifications to the model, because my training data was not very extensive and, although the validation error was always below the training error, tests *on the field* showed high overfitting. The main modifications were:\n",
    " 1. Non-linear activation functions after convolutional layers (in particular, CReLU after the very first).\n",
    " 2. Dropout layer between convolutional layers and flattening.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. The bridge was a critical point. Even if most of the the model was able to drive all the way through, when exiting the bridge it turned either left or right leaving the lane. To overcome this issue I recorded some more training data explicitly taken on the bridge, in both the directions. This permitted the model to learn how to deal properly with it.\n",

    "At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road."
